# JDBC - Apache POI - Cryptography

In this branch I have put a mini project where I 
- read the contents of a EXCEL file,
- convert them to a list of objects
- for each object I calculate the weight of the certification
 - and Prepare a Statement using PreparedStatement from the JDBC API
 - each of this statements I log in the console and save into a file. 
 
 ## They can easily be excecuted in the database  from this App API or directly into PostgreSQL because the driver of Postgres in JDBC system outs (to string) the query along with the bound params.
